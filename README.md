## What this package does
This package allows for easy tag and release management for github.  

## Use case
If you frequently release to github and want an easy option to replace or create a new tag/release.  Instead of deleting tags, pushing tags, and naming tags, simply use `git-tag-release new` and  `git-tag-release replace` to create a new release or replace a previous release.
